Every so often I like to pretend that I know how to make music and will open up garageband or the like to make a "quick" 20ish second heavy sample using song.

I say "quick" because I get caught up on two things: My lack of musical skills as a whole (This is a non-github project I'm working on ;)) as well as the sheer amount of time I'll spend perusing all kinds of music to sample for my track.

I'm sure this'll get hammered out naturally by continuing playing and making music, but I figured it would be a neat idea to utilize discog's API to make a project out of this in the meanwhile.
